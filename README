Building under Linux:
    I usually do out of source builds, so make a dir outside of
    where this project is and:
        cd <your_build_dir>
        cmake <path_to_project_root>
        make

    for ex:
    git clone https://EssEss@github.com/EssEss/freeems-cst.git
    mkdir build; cd build
    cmake ../freeems-cst
    make

Building under Windows:
